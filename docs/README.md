## Milestone Description <a href="#milestone-description" id="milestone-description"></a>

M3.3 Comparative WBLCA models finalization and delivery \[Due Q10 - January 24, 2025]

> “Delivery of structured cradle-to-grave WBLCA template models with modeled scenarios to compare at least five mid/endpoint impact categories including GWP/climate change, dynamic impacts over the lifetime of the building, supply chain impacts including land use / land use change of input materials, and end-of-life impacts of HESTIA building designs to those of conventional building practice/assemblies/materials.”

## Scenario Explorer Goals & Structure <a href="#scenario-explorer-goals-structure" id="scenario-explorer-goals-structure"></a>

The POD|LCA WBLCA Scenario Explorer is made from a set of structured WBLCA template models with pre-built scenarios. The tool allows users to enter project information and explore changes to the model results related to specific scenarios and methodological decisions.

This version, currently in development, is a POC model that will allow us to continue to develop background data infrastructure and model code base for future POD LCA tools. At the time of submission of Milestone 3.3, the team aims to complete a fully functional model along with updated documentation and datasets for use by our internal tool development & framework team.

## About the dashboard <a href="#about-the-dashboard" id="about-the-dashboard"></a>

At present, the dashboard is in beta. There are currently two types of pages of note:

* Results - the traditional results for a WBLCA.
* Scenarios - These will show different scenarios built by the UW Team to enable the user to compare different scenarios against the template model. There are currently four different scenarios mocked up in this dashboard:
  * Transportation Scenarios
  * Construction Scenarios
  * Replacement Scenarios
  * End-of-life Scenarios

An additional section of the dashboard will facilitate selection or upload of a base building model, or the generation of a detailed, structured Bill of Materials (BoM). This element is still in scoping and development and not yet ready to be shared.
