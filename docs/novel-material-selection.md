# Novel Material Selection

## Description

The novel material selection page is still in progress. The intent of the page is to allow a user to input a unique material into the tool, which would then allow for that material to replace a component of the building and have that propagate throughout the results. This result would be visible in the Scenario Explorer and Model Comparison pages.&#x20;

## Methodology

First, a building component must be chosen to replace. Given the template model selected in the previous page, the user can choose a component of the building based on the building Omniclass level 3 characterization and assembly.&#x20;

After the component is chosen, the novel material must be characterized. This material must have the following values ready for entry:

* Name
* Functional unit
* Density
* Expected service life
* Expected wastage rate
* Stored biogenic carbon per kilogram, if applicable

Following this entry, the environmental impacts for the creation, transportation, and disposal must be entered. The rest of the impacts will be calculated by the tool and added into the results.
