# Model Comparison

## Description

The model comparison page is meant to show the scenarios at a _building level_. Whereas the [Scenario Explorer Page](scenario-explorer.md) is meant to show the impacts of design decisions at a life cycle stage level, this page shows how the impacts of these decisions impact the total environmnetal impact of the building.&#x20;

The graph shows the full building impacts, and only one scenario can be chosen per life cycle stage.&#x20;

See the [Scenario Explorer Page](scenario-explorer.md) for a full list of scenarios that are included.
